transcript_2.txt,"Member: Hi, I'm calling about my recent doctor's visit. I was charged a copay of $50, but I thought my policy covered that service with a $20 copay.

Customer Support: Okay, I've located the claim. It looks like the copay amount was indeed $50. However, I'm going to check on the policy details to see if there was an error.

Member: Yeah, because my policy says that routine physical exams have a $20 copay or sometimes no copay at all.

Customer Support: I understand your concern, Mr. Johnson. I'm checking on the policy details... (pause) Okay, I've checked, and it looks like there might have been an error in the copay amount. However, I need to escalate this to our claims department to investigate further.

Customer Support: Okay, let me check on that. (pause) I'm seeing that the copay for that service is indeed $50 according to our records.

Member: But that's not what my policy says! I'm looking at it right now, and it says I shouldn't have to pay more than $20 for that type of service.

Customer Support: I understand your concern, but I assure you that our records are accurate. However, I can try to investigate this further. Can you please hold for a moment?

Member: (sighs) Fine.
